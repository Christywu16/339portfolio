            The Moon and Sixpence<br>
            by W. Somerset Maugham
          </h2>
          <p>
            Summary: In the first person, through the description of the heart 
            of the central character Charles Strickland, it shows how a 
            middle-aged British stockbroker suddenly left his wife and 
            children to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. The first story
             is based on the life of the painter Paul Gauguin.

            Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies<br>
            by Jared Diamond
          </h2>
          <p>
            Summary: According to the author, this book attempts to provide "a 
            brief history of all people in the last 13,000 years" [1]. But this 
            book is not just a book describing past history; it attempts to explain 
            why Eurasian civilization can finally survive and defeat other 
            civilizations, while refuting that Eurasian hegemony is derived from 
            Eurasian intellectuals or moral superiority. Dimon believes that the 
            differences between rights and technology in human society cannot reflect 
            cultural or ethnic differences, but come from environmental differences that 
            are strongly expanded by various positive feedback cycles.

          Malice: A Mystery<br>
          by Keigo Higashino
        </h2>
        <p>
          Summary: Acclaimed bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka is found brutally 
          murdered in his home on the night before he's planning to leave Japan and 
          relocate to Vancouver. His body is found in his office, a locked room, within 
          his locked house, by his wife and his best friend, both of whom have rock 
          solid alibis. Or so it seems.
