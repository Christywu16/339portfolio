            Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind<br>
            by Yuval Noah Harari
          </h2>
          <p><br>
            Summary: The author tells the history of human evolution 
            and development from the Stone Age to the 21st century, and 
            divides human history into four stages: the cognitive 
            revolution, the agricultural revolution, the integration and 
            unity of mankind and the scientific revolution. The book was 
            heavily influenced by Judd Diamond's "Guns, Germs, and Steel". 
            Since the publication of the Hebrew edition in 2011, the book has 
            been translated into 45 languages.

            Nineteen Eighty-Four<br>
            by George Orwell
          </h2>
          <p><br>
            Summary: It focuses on the risk of overextension of government 
            power, totalitarianism, and repressive rule over all people and 
            behaviors in society. The time of the story is set in 1984-the 
            author's imaginary vision of the future at that time.

            The Silent Majority<br>
            by Xiaobo Wang
          </h2>
          <p><br>
            Summary: The point of view is that the author has devoted his 
            attention to the fate of the Chinese people in this work, 
            confronting life with irony and humor, and deconstructing the 
            complex situation around him from a relaxed perspective.
