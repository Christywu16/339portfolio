                Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind<br>
                by Yuval Noah Harari
              </h2>
              <p><br>
                Summary: The author tells the history of human evolution 
                and development from the Stone Age to the 21st century, and 
                divides human history into four stages: the cognitive 
                revolution, the agricultural revolution, the integration and 
                unity of mankind and the scientific revolution. The book was 
                heavily influenced by Judd Diamond's "Guns, Germs, and Steel". 
                Since the publication of the Hebrew edition in 2011, the book has 
                been translated into 45 languages.

            Nineteen Eighty-Four<br>
            by George Orwell
          </h2>
          <p><br>
            Summary: It focuses on the risk of overextension of government 
            power, totalitarianism, and repressive rule over all people and 
            behaviors in society. The time of the story is set in 1984-the 
            author's imaginary vision of the future at that time.

              The Silent Majority<br>
              by Xiaobo Wang
            </h2>
            <p><br>
              Summary: The point of view is that the author has devoted his 
              attention to the fate of the Chinese people in this work, 
              confronting life with irony and humor, and deconstructing the 
              complex situation around him from a relaxed perspective.

          The little Prince<br>
              by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
        </h2>
        <p><br>
          Summary: The story follows a young prince who visits various 
          planets in space, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, 
          friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book, 
          The Little Prince makes observations about life and human nature.

            The Old Man and The Sea<br>
            by Ernest Hemingway
          </h2>
          <p><br>
            Summary: The Old Man and the Sea tells the story of a battle between 
            an aging, experienced fisherman, Santiago, and a large marlin. 
            The story opens with Santiago having gone 84 days without catching a fish, 
            and now being seen as "salao", the worst form of unluckiness.

              Summary: Afghani immigrant Amir is summoned from his California home 
              to Pakistan by Rahim Khan, an old, dying friend of his father. As a

              Hassan, but when Hassan was brutally assaulted by a local bully, Amir 
              was too scared to save him, and has been tormented by guilt ever since.
